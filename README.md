✅ What we do know about passkeys / WebAuthn / FIDO2

“Passkeys” are (in practice) just WebAuthn credentials: a public-private keypair generated by a user's authenticator (phone, security key, etc.), with the public key & credential ID stored on the server, and the private key kept securely on the client device.

For web apps, the client-side uses the standard WebAuthn API — e.g. navigator.credentials.create() to register, navigator.credentials.get() to authenticate.

On the server side, you must: generate challenges, send appropriate options to the client, receive the credential on registration, store the public key + metadata; and on authentication, verify the signature/assertion using the public key.

Because this logic involves cryptographic operations (parsing CBOR, verifying signatures, handling attestation formats), most implementations rely on libraries rather than raw from-scratch C code.

Indeed, in a recent survey of passkey-supporting SDKs, under the “C” category the only listed library is libfido2 — a low-level library for interacting with FIDO devices / authenticators (U2F / FIDO2) from C (or C-compatible) applications.

Most of the higher-level “server libraries / SDKs” used for passkey (WebAuthn) workflows are in languages like Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.

🔍 Why there’s no ready-made “C + Google-passkey + Example” on GitHub (as far as I know)

WebAuthn assumes a browser or “client authenticator” API — that doesn’t map naturally to “pure C backend only”. The browser side is JS/HTML.

The server side must parse and verify WebAuthn data (CBOR, signature, attestation). Doing this securely and correctly from “raw C” would be error-prone. Hence most devs choose higher-level languages.

As a result, no popular open-source project appears to provide a complete end-to-end passkey (registration + login) implementation purely in C.

🧰 What you can do if you want to build in C / integrate with a C backend

Use libfido2 — the library listed for C in passkey / FIDO2 SDK surveys. This gives you low-level access to FIDO2 authenticators, credential creation/validation, etc. 
Corbado
+1

Use a higher-level language or environment (e.g. Node.js / Python / Java) for the WebAuthn server logic, and have that communicate with your C backend — e.g. your C backend could store keys, manage sessions etc., while the WebAuthn-handling layer deals with parsing the credential data.

Alternatively, embed/port parts of a higher-level WebAuthn library (if license permits), or write your own C wrapper around libfido2 + CBOR / ASN.1 / JSON parser + signature verification — but be ready for security pitfalls.

📚 References & Recommended Starting Points

The curated list of WebAuthn/Passkey resources — awesome-webauthn on GitHub — includes many libraries and demos for various languages. 
GitHub

The “best passkey SDKs / libraries” survey shows that for C the recommended library is libfido2. 
Corbado

The official “server implementation guide” from Google recommends using WebAuthn (browser) or Credential Manager (Android) for client side — and a server that can verify the public-key credentials on backend.

🎯 My Recommendation (Given Your Request)

If you want to build passkey authentication and prefer C (or have a C server), I suggest:

Use libfido2 for low-level FIDO / passkey support.

Build a small module in a higher-level language (Node.js / Python / Java) to handle the WebAuthn protocol details — parsing credential creation / assertion responses (CBOR JSON, signature verification).

Have that module interface with your C server (via local API, IPC, or embedding).

This gives you both reliability (correct WebAuthn handling) and performance / integration with your C backend.
